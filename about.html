<p>EpicMode is a disruptive project for the Fashion industry. Fashion and Textiles is the world's 2nd largest industry 
	($2.3T USD per year), 2nd largest polluter, and 1st largest user of child and indentured slave labor. 
	Change will not happen from within in the conservative Fashion industry.  New players, processes, workflows, 
	and a grassroots global movement designed specifically for change is required.</p>
		
<p>EpicMode enables change by redefining the production process from design through manufacturing. 
	EpicMode positions the fashion industry for success in the Next Economy by utilizing open source code, 
	open data formats, collaborative culture, parametric design. 
	EpicMode removes barriers to entry, improves efficiency, eliminates Victorian pseudo-science, and 
	introduces collaborative shareable re-sizable patterns and on-demand production into the 100% 
	proprietary and secretive Fashion industry. EpicMode enables use of new materials and circuitry, 
	new shapes of clothing, and new methods of design and production enhanced with 3D and Virtual Reality.</p>
		
<p>Other industries can benefit from EpicMode's 3D and VR design and production features. 
	EpicMode's single solution workflow can create digital clothing for use in film, gaming and animation, 
	and online sales. With EpicMode, you and your gaming character can wear the same clothes and armor. 
	Changes made in VR autopopulates to your production pattern and your online catalog.
