		<p>EpicMode is a disruptive project for the 2nd largest industry ($2.3T USD) on the planet, surpassed only by the oil and gas industry. Fashion is also the 2nd largest polluter. Sadly, it is also the largest user of child and indentured slave labor, in greater numbers than used by the weapons, drug, and sex trafficking cartels. 
		
		<p>Change will not happen from within in the conservative fashion industry. New players, processes, and workflows are required. A grassroots movement designed specifically for change is required.</p>
		
		<p>EpicMode can enable change by redefining the process from design through manufacturing for the Next Economy. It is the beginning of a new stack of tools to rebuild and recreate this broken industry.  Change won't happen from within in the conservative fashion industry.  </p>
		
		<p>We have contributors and advisors in Ukraine, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, France, Germany, England, and USA. We have presented at conferences and held workshops in Singapore, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Austria, Belgium, Germany, England, and Canada.</p>
		

<p>Valentina open source pattern drafting software (www.valentina-project.org) enables profits for small batch and custom-size garment by making 'smart' patterns, where each pattern fits any body of any size in any market. Valentina brings 21st century technology and engineering principles into garment design, and improves garment fit by removing ethnic and gender biases. By introducing parametric design, open data formats, open source code, and collaborative culture to the fashion industry, Valentina can remove artificial barriers to entry and enable higher profits. Valentina can make a difference in the lives of women around the world.</p> 
 
<p>The Valentina development team would like to enable persons in underdeveloped communities and on underdeveloped continents to become participants in this industry. Independent designers anywhere can create garment profitably by utilizing any manufacturer through the use of open data formats. By enabling independent garment manufacturing for single and small batch sizes Valentina also enables demand for small and artisanal textiles from small and medium sized textile mills around the globe. Healthy  and textile districts with smaller working communities can reduce the levels of child and indentured slave labor used in garment manufacturing.</p>  

<p>As an additional goal for Valentina, educators from Lebanon and Egypt have requested an Arabic translation of Valentina.  They indicated that learning pattern drafting software with Valentina would be allowed in conservative religious communities in the Middle East, where women are not normally taught math or given access to computers.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Valentina concluded a 3D Design Sprint, sponsored by Adidas, during the Libre Graphics Meeting at the University of Westminster in London, April 13-18, 2016. The meeting determined the architecture and roadmap for adding 3D Character, 3D Measurement, 3D Pattern, and 3D Visualization features.</p>

<p>The University of Pisa, CNR-ISTI, MeshLab (www.meshlab.js), and MakeHuman (www.makehuman.org) are working together to provide Valentina's 3D mesh, surface reconstruction, measurements, and animation.</p>

<p>The University of Parma is currently developing additional Valentina pre-processing features.</p>

<p>Georgia Institute of Technology's Institute for People and Technology is in the early stages of defining a program for Valentina 3D Visualization.</p>

<p>The Arte Diez (artediez.es) charter school in Madrid is developing a Valentina training manual for use in their design program.</p>

<h3>Call for partners</h3>

<p>Valentina is seeking individual, NGO, organizational, and university partners to develop 2D and 3D graphics features, provide project management, design the user interface, manage translations, create an international website, and develop international educational materials. </p>
